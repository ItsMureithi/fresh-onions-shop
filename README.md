## 💥 What Inspired Me to Build This Project

I chose to create an onion delivery site for my brother who is an entrepreneur in Karatina Market because I believe technology can elevate even the simplest businesses.With a focus on clean UI and responsiveness, **Waweru Onion Cart** was born, a gift to local Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to local entrepreneurs and digital innovation!
